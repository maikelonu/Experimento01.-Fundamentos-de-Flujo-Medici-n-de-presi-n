# Accuracy:
# Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a known value (or standard),
# where 0 represents no agreement and 1 represents perfect agreement.
#
# Precision:
# Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other,
# where 0 represents no agreement and 1 represents perfect agreement.
# For example, if on average, your measurements for a given substance are close 
# to the known value, but the measurements are far from each other, 
# then you have accuracy without precision.
#
# Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC): 
# The CCC can be written as the product of the accuracy and the 
# precision coefficients. It measures the agreement along the identity line,
# in which a value of 1 represents a perfect agreement, a value of -1 represents
# a perfect disagreement and a value of 0 represents no agreement.
#
# Total Deviation Index (TDI) + Coverage probability (CP):
# An intuitively clear measurement of agreement is a measure that captures
# a large proportion of data within a predetermined boundary from target values.
# For example, we may want to capture at least 90% of individual observations that are
# within 10 mmHg of their target values (blood pressure). In other words, 
# one can assume that the manual instrument can be replaced by the automatic
# device if a large proportion of paired-measurement differences are within 
# a boundary of 10 mmHg. The CP describes the proportion captured within a 
# pre-specified boundary of the absolute paired-measurement differences from two devices.
